The task is a classification task to predict the forest cover type in an area based on cartographic information. There are 7 different cover types in the dataset 'TypeA' through to 'TypeG'. The target feature is listed in the last column of each row.

There are 54 columns of descriptive data for each instance.
- 10 quantitative features,
- 4 binary wilderness areas features,
- 40 binary soil type features

Feature descriptions:

Below I list the feature name, feature type, the measurement unit and
a brief description. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of
columns along the rows of the dataset.
